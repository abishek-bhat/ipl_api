<br>
This is a project that predicts the outcomes of IPL (Indian Premier League) matches using Ridge Regressor and Flask. Python and scikit-learn are used to build the project.
<br>
<h1>Getting Started</h1>
get started with this project, you'll need to do the following:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Run the Flask app using python app.py.
<h1>How to Use</h1>

After the Flask app is up and running, you can use the web interface to enter the names of the teams and the location of the match, and the software will predict the result using Ridge Regressor. If you like, you can also download the dataset and train the model yourself.
<br>
<h1>FILES</h1>
<br>
app.py: the Flask app that handles the user interface and prediction.<br>
model.py: the script that trains the Ridge Regressor model on the IPL dataset.<br>
ipl.csv: the IPL dataset used for training the model.<br>
home.html: the HTML template for the user interface.<br>
style.css: the CSS stylesheet for the user interface.<br>
<h1>DATASET</h1>
<br>
The IPL dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle. It contains data on all IPL matches played between 2008 and 2020, including the teams, venues, and outcomes<br>
<h1>Data Cleaning and Preprocessing</h1>

Calculating metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to measure the model's performance<br>
Visualizing the performance of the model using tools like confusion matrix, ROC curve, and precision-recall curve<br>
<h1>Feature Engineering</h1>
Exploring and analyzing the IPL dataset to identify relevant features for the prediction task<br>
Creating new features by combining or transforming existing features<br>
Scaling or normalizing features to improve model performance<br>
<h1>Model Interpretation</h1>
Interpreting the trained Ridge Regressor model to understand how it makes predictions<br>
Examining the coefficients of the model to identify the most important features for prediction<br>
Visualizing the coefficients using tools like bar charts or heatmaps<br>
<h1>Error Analysis</h1>
Analyzing the errors made by the trained model on the testing dataset<br>
Identifying patterns in the errors and determining if there are any systematic biases or issues with the model<br>
Using the insights gained from error analysis to improve the model or dataset<br>
<h1>Model Optimization</h1>
Using techniques like feature selection, regularization, or ensemble methods to optimize the model<br>
Evaluating the performance of the optimized model on the testing dataset<br>
Comparing the performance of the optimized model with the original model to see if it improves<br>
<h1>Integration with Other Tools</h1><br>
Integrating the Flask app with other tools like email or messaging services to notify users of new predictions<br>
Creating an API endpoint for the Flask app so that other developers can access the predictions programmatically<br>
Storing the predictions and user inputs in a database for analysis or further processing<br>
<h1>OPEN API CONCEPT</h1>
Start by setting up your development environment on the Intel DevCloud for the Edge. You can use the OpenVINO 2020.3.2 LTS kernel to access the Intel Open API libraries and tools.<br>
Load the IPL prediction dataset into your Jupyter Notebook. The dataset should include historical data on IPL matches, teams, players, and their performances.<br>
Preprocess the data to extract the relevant features and prepare it for training your Ridge Regressor model. You can use pandas and numpy libraries to perform this step.<br>
Train your Ridge Regressor model using the preprocessed data. You can use the scikit-learn library to create and train the model.<br>
Once the model is trained, save it to disk using the pickle library.<br>
Use the Intel Open API libraries, such as the Intel Distribution of OpenVINO Toolkit, to optimize your prediction code for performance and scalability.<br>
